# Visualization Metaphor


## The City Metaphor in Software Visualization

A city metaphor has become a popular method of visualizing properties of program code. This paper provides an overview
of research projects that employ this metaphor for a wide range of software engineering tasks. Until now, projects 
employing the city metaphor have primarily focused on visualizing static and semi-static properties of software 
repositories, such as understanding how a programâ€™s source code structure is changing over time,
and who is changing what. This paper compares these research.

 * Path to production is adapted from lean value stream mapping, which is used in the manufacturing industry to
 * improve processes in production throughput and analyze the cost of delay. The creation of a P2P is a task that
 * involves the whole team. Each and every activity in the context of product development is registered and brought
 * into a logical order.
 *
 * - People: Groups, Boards, Individuals
 * - Media: Meetings, Jour Fixe, Committees, Calls, eMails
 * - Deliverables: Reports, Analyses, User Stories, Commits, Containers, â€¦
 * - Security controls alongside each step: Threat Modeling, Tests, Logging, Scanners, ...
